## Comments

This was a challenging assignment for me and I ran into several "brick walls" in styling. I was able to work through the issues and feel really accomplished with the end result. I didn't actually see the screen shots in the assets folder from the GitLab instructions until the very end of my build. I'm hoping my styling changes don't impact my grade negatively.
